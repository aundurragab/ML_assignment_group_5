    *Welcome to the Heart Attack Prediction App!*
    This application is designed to provide you with a quick and simple assessment of your potential risk of experiencing a heart attack based on your current health status and lifestyle choices. Our goal is to empower you with knowledge so that you can take proactive steps towards maintaining your heart health.

    *How does it work?*
    1. *Input Your Information:* You will be asked to provide specific details about your health and lifestyle. These include your physical health days, general health condition, smoking status, and more. All of these factors play a significant role in determining your heart health.
    2. *Get Your Risk Assessment:* Once you submit your information, our advanced prediction model, which has been trained on a wide range of health data, will analyze your inputs and calculate your potential risk of having a heart attack.

    *Please Note:*
    - This tool is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
    - The prediction is based on general trends and patterns in health data, and individual variations may exist.

    *Take Charge of Your Heart Health Today!*
    By understanding your risk and taking steps to live a healthier lifestyle, you can reduce your chances of heart disease and lead a longer, healthier life.
